# Scrap paper

## A simple notetaker made with encore and htmx

### Overview:

Folder structure is pretty standard for an encore app:

```
root (encore)
├── lib/            # A shared utility internal library
└── scrap-paper/    # The proof of concept and experimental area
```

### Dependencies:

For now it is a small list and we strive to keep it small.

- Frameworks:

  - encore.dev -> Backend framework
  - htmx.org -> Frontend framework(?)

- Packages:

  - https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/kr/pretty -> a handy pretty print for Go structs
